## D4 - Project Review

### Project Name: digital-tech-news-corporation
### Team Name, Team Number: Deliverable, Team 15
### Github Link: https://github.com/csc301-2024-s/deliverable-1-15-digital-tech-news-corporation

### Project Summary:
The organization, trying to output an increasing volume of news articles, seeks to utilize generative AI to solve this through the application the students have developed.
The application is a backend system for staff at the Daily Scrum News to quickly generate models that are used to generate news articles automatically at regular intervals based on location and topic from web-scraped data.
The group contributed to the application by automating model creation and deployment processes, adding a system to add source articles directly to an AI-generated news article, optimizing API token usage by reducing 
the number of API calls, and improving on the UI.

### Introduction & Overview of the problem and the product:
It isn't immediately clear why the system is in need in the first place. AI-generated news generally suffers from inaccuracies and data hallucinations. In other words, there may be alternate ways to produce more content that doesn't involve AI, and these non-AI methods may be significantly more accurate than AI approaches. This has become a problem in recent years, with lawyers having their cases dismissed due to similar uses of AI, so the proliferation of AI in journalism like this may harm the journalistic integrity of the organization using AI.
It is relatively straightforward to parse an overview of the project; the README clearly outlines each feature developed and what role each feature plays within the larger product.
It is easy to differentiate what the project does and how it differs from existing or prior work; each feature mentioned is either self-contained or specifically improves on existing features in specific ways.
It would be helpful to include a short description of why the organization wants to use AI in this particular way. It is unclear whether or not the AI journalists would have their names shown or if they would be differentiated as AI journalists. It could be misleading to viewers of AI-generated articles if there is no such differentiation.

### Demo of the application:
The ideas presented in the demo were entirely clear and easy to understand.
The demo demonstrated all key features clearly and concisely, and it helped me understand where the product belongs in the wider project.

### Technical Discussion & Key Learnings:
The technical aspects of the project are difficult to understand and are not immediately clear. It isn't explained how API token usage was optimized, and the prompt engineering with the API was entirely obscured. Additionally, the exact technologies used, their systems and structure, and how they were used were neither in the demo nor the readme.
The key learnings presented by the team make sense from a retrospective point of view, though they are a bit vague. It isn't elaborated on what specifically the team had trouble with, only that some trouble or difficulties with certain technologies existed. 
Greater explanations in this regard would be very helpful.

### Project Documentation:
The project readme was very easy to follow and it gives all necessary details about features implemented. However, more in-depth explanation as to the structure of the code and how the code is implemented would be immensely helpful.
It is very easy to read and follow the readme, and provides detailed step-by-step instructions on how to access and deploy the project.
The initial paragraph on the readme lacks concise explanations as to what the project is and other essential information, though it makes up for it in later sections. Regardless, the first paragraph is exceedingly verbose and needs to be trimmed down.
General code structure and software engineering principles regarding clean code and other design paradigms are missing but very heavily implied. Perhaps more information on what the code structure looks like could be useful, especially to future teams looking to build on the project. They may need a bit of a push with regard to interpreting the code structure.

### Project Deployment:
The instructions were clear and the product was easy to access. 
However, I was unable to access the majority of the deployed product because on the sign-up screen, I was invited to register, but the error "ERROR for site owner: Invalid domain for site key" was preventing me from accessing the rest of the product. 
I wasn't able to test the application in any way as a result, nor was I able to consider edge cases. 
The UI of the application is fairly standard and easy to access.
