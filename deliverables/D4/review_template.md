### Project Name: digital-tech-news-corporation
### Team Name, Team Number: Deliverable, Team 15
### Github Link: https://github.com/csc301-2024-s/deliverable-1-15-digital-tech-news-corporation

### Project Summary:
The organization, trying to output an increasing volume of news articles, seeks to utilize generative AI to solve this through the application the students have developed.
The application is a backend system for staff at the Daily Scrum News to quickly generate models that are used to generate news articles automatically at regular intervals based on location and topic from web-scraped data.
The group contributed to the application by automating model creation and deployment processes, adding a system to add source articles directly to an AI-generated news article, optimizing API token usage by reducing 
the number of API calls, and improving on the UI.



### Introduction & Overview of the problem and the product:

It isn't immediately clear why the system is in need in the first place. AI-generated news generally suffers from inaccuracies and data hallucinations. In other words, there may be alternate ways to produce more content that doesn't involve AI, and these non-AI methods may be significantly more accurate than AI approaches. This has become a problem in recent years, with lawyers having their cases dismissed due to similar uses of AI, so the proliferation of AI in journalism like this may harm the journalistic integrity of the organization using AI.
It is relatively straightforward to parse an overview of the project; the README clearly outlines each feature developed and what role each feature plays within the larger product.
It is easy to differentiate what the project does and how it differs from existing or prior work; each feature mentioned is either self-contained or specifically improves on existing features in specific ways.
It would be helpful to include a short description of why the organization wants to use AI in this particular way. It is unclear whether or not the AI journalists would have their names shown or if they would be differentiated as AI journalists. It could be misleading to viewers of AI-generated articles if there is no such differentiation.
### Demo of the application:
The ideas presented in the demo were entirely clear and easy to understand.
The demo demonstrated all key features clearly and concisely, and it helped me understand where the product belongs in the wider project.
### Technical Discussion & Key Learnings:
The technical aspects of the project are difficult to understand and are not immediately clear. It isn't explained how API token usage was optimized, and the prompt engineering with the API was entirely obscured. Additionally, the exact technologies used, their systems and structure, and how they were used were neither in the demo nor the readme.
The key learnings presented by the team make sense from a retrospective point of view, though they are a bit vague. It isn't elaborated on what specifically the team had trouble with, only that some trouble or difficulties with certain technologies existed. 
Greater explanations in this regard would be very helpful.

### Project Documentation:
_* Was the project readme easy to follow and gives all the necessary details about the project?_

_* For a new user (such as yourself), how approachable and easy is it to read and follow the readme?_

_* Are there technical or major writing errors that prevents a good understanding or leads to confusion?_

_* Do you think there are gaps in the documentation or points that could have improved its quality?_

### Project Deployment:
_* Were you able to follow the instructions and install the application on your device?_

_* Did the application run without any errors?_

_* Were you able to test at least the basic / most significant features of the application?_

_* Were there any edge cases that you feel the application doesn't consider?_

_* Is the UI of the application representative of a product similar to this project?_

_* Any points that would have helped to improve this aspect?_

### Misc.:
_* Are there any other points that you want to comment on / give your feedback?_

_* These could be points that were not captured above, but you think will help to improve the product quality._
